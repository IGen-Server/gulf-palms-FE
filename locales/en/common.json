    "description": "Gulf Palms General Trading & Contracting Company (Tissue Culture Palms Centre) was established in 1991 immediately after the invasion. The nursery was purchased in Ar Rai, and palm offshoots were imported from Saudi Arabia. Faced with challenges in importing offshoots of quality varieties, they decided to source from American tissue culture laboratories. Offshoots of the best and most popular palm varieties in the Gulf region were collected and sent to the States for micropropagation. Later, the agreement was terminated, and all the cultures were shifted to Jacques Marionnet, France, which appointed Gulf Palms as its agent in Kuwait & Saudi Arabia.",
